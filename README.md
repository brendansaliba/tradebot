## Getting Started

If you are using a Python virtual environment, activate it using

```shell
> source venv/bin/activate
```

Then run

## Running Tests with Pytest

Tests written with Pytest live in `tests/`. To run the tests, use the shell command

## File Structure Not Tracked By Git

There is supporting infra required for this project to function. All supporting directories should be auto-generated if they do not exist. These additional directories should include:

```
config/
data/
logs/
```

Additionally, a `.env` file should be included and contain your sensitive information, such as

```text
# schwab
SCHWAB_APP_KEY=yourschwabappkey
SCHWAB_APP_SECRET=yourschwabappsecret
```

Other files/folders generated by your local IDE/editor configuration should be added to `.gitignore`.
